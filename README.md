## Creational
Creational patterns are ones that create objects, rather than having to instantiate objects directly. This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.

### Abstract factory 
Groups object factories that have a common theme.

### Builder 
Constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.

### Factory 
Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.

### Prototype 
Creates objects by cloning an existing object.

### Singleton 
Restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
